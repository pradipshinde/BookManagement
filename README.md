# BookManagement#
we’ll develop a back-end solution that can be used with any front-end (Web, mobiles…).
The goal of the application is to be able to administer books. 
In particular, we’ll develop the back-end solution for that application that should be able to:

1.Add new book
2.Update existing book
3.Delete an existing book
4.List all books
5.Display details of the selected book
6.Delete all books

All the code will be done in the TDD fashion

Following frameworks and libraries are selected for the back-end of this application:

Gradle:     Gradle can automate the building, testing, publishing, deployment and more of software packages 
            or other types of projects such as generated static websites, generated documentation or indeed 
            anything else. It combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency management and 
            conventions of Maven into a more effective way to build.
JUnit:      Simple framework to write repeatable tests.
Hamcrest:   Provides a library of matcher objects.
JSONAssert: Allows easier creation of JSON tests.
HSQLDB:     HSQLDB offers a small, fast multithreaded and transactional database engine with in-memory and
            disk-based tables and supports embedded and server modes.
Hibernate:  Hibernate is idiomatic persistence for Java and relational databases.
Jersey:     Jersey helps with development of RESTful Web Services in Java.
Grizzly:    Grizzly helps developers to build scalable and robust servers using NIO as well as offering extended
            framework components: Web Framework (HTTP/S), WebSocket, Comet, and more.
          
The following frameworks and libraries are selected for the front-end of this application:

AngularJS     : AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running 
                single-page applications. Its goal is to augment web-based applications with model–view–controller
                (MVC) capability, in an effort to make both development and testing easier.
Bootstrap CSS : Global CSS settings, fundamental HTML elements styled and enhanced with extensible classes, and an 
                advanced grid system.
JQuery        : jQuery is a multi-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
Jasmine       : Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
